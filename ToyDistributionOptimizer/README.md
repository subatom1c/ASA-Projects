This project implements an optimization algorithm to maximize the number of children receiving their requested toys while respecting production, stock, country export limits, and minimum distribution constraints. Using Python and the PuLP library, the program models the problem as a linear program, considering multiple factories, countries, and individual toy requests. The solution outputs the maximum number of satisfied children or -1 if the constraints cannot be met.
